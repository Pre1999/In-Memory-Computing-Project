WARNING (XSTRM-75): Target library 'Decoder' is attached to the technology library 'NCSU_TechLib_tsmc02d'. Therefore, the technology file is opened in read-only mode. All the undefined layer-purpose pairs will be dropped.
WARNING (XSTRM-107): Existing cells in the target library will be overwritten if the cell names in the Stream file and the target library are the same. To prevent this, set the '-writeMode' option to 'noOverwrite'.
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /package/eda/cells/OSU/v2.7/cadence/lib/source/gds2/streamin.map
INFO (XSTRM-163): You have not used the viaMap option. If a viaMap file, corresponding techfile or technology library exist, then use the -viaMap option for creating oaVia instances in the Streamed-In library. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design. For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.

Summary of Options:
	library				Decoder
	strmFile			/home/ecegrid/a/559mg16/SRAM_PnR/decoder.merge.gds
	logFile				strmIn.log
	topCell				decoder
	view				layout

WARNING (XSTRM-284): DbuPerUU (1000) specified in the technology database or using '-dbuPerUU' is not divisible by the value (10000) set in the GDSII file. This can cause loss in data precision during translation.
INFO (XSTRM-220): 1. Translating STRUCTURE AND2X2 as cellView Decoder/AND2X2/layout.
WARNING (XSTRM-36): The objects in the stream layer-datatype '81:0' are ignored. This is because the stream layer-datatype pair is either not specified in the layer map file or the entry is invalid and was therefore ignored. Specify the stream layer-datatype pair in the layer map file or correct the wrong entry and try again.
INFO (XSTRM-220): 2. Translating STRUCTURE AOI21X1 as cellView Decoder/AOI21X1/layout.
WARNING (XSTRM-36): The objects in the stream layer-datatype '81:0' are ignored. This is because the stream layer-datatype pair is either not specified in the layer map file or the entry is invalid and was therefore ignored. Specify the stream layer-datatype pair in the layer map file or correct the wrong entry and try again.
INFO (XSTRM-220): 3. Translating STRUCTURE AOI22X1 as cellView Decoder/AOI22X1/layout.
WARNING (XSTRM-36): The objects in the stream layer-datatype '81:0' are ignored. This is because the stream layer-datatype pair is either not specified in the layer map file or the entry is invalid and was therefore ignored. Specify the stream layer-datatype pair in the layer map file or correct the wrong entry and try again.
INFO (XSTRM-220): 4. Translating STRUCTURE BUFX2 as cellView Decoder/BUFX2/layout.
WARNING (XSTRM-36): The objects in the stream layer-datatype '81:0' are ignored. This is because the stream layer-datatype pair is either not specified in the layer map file or the entry is invalid and was therefore ignored. Specify the stream layer-datatype pair in the layer map file or correct the wrong entry and try again.
INFO (XSTRM-220): 5. Translating STRUCTURE NOR3X1 as cellView Decoder/NOR3X1/layout.
WARNING (XSTRM-36): The objects in the stream layer-datatype '81:0' are ignored. This is because the stream layer-datatype pair is either not specified in the layer map file or the entry is invalid and was therefore ignored. Specify the stream layer-datatype pair in the layer map file or correct the wrong entry and try again.
